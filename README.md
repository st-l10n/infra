Infrastructure description.

Currently, everything is deployed via [Ansible playbook](https://github.com/st-l10n/pontoon-playbook)
to Hetzner cloud on single CPX31 instance (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM).

Most automation is done as bunch of bash-cripts (should be also in [playbook](https://github.com/st-l10n/pontoon-playbook)) and 
[martian](https://github.com/st-l10n/martian), tool for localization in go.

## Repositories

The [st-l10n](https://github.com/st-l10n) github organization contains multiple 
repos related to Stationeers localization.

### Martian

The [martian](https://github.com/st-l10n/martian) tool solves multiple problems:
* Generating `.po` files from English `.xml` files for every language
* Generating translated `.xml` files from `.po` files and English `.xml` files
* Notifying about new asset version to discord channel

### Locales

The [locales](https://github.com/st-l10n/locales) repo is managed by Pontoon (and sometimes by martian, e.g. for `.pot`)
and contains `.po` and `.pot` files.

> A .PO file is a portable object file, which is text-based.
These types of files are used in commonly in software development.
The .PO file may be referenced by Java programs, GNU gettext, or other software programs as a properties file. These files are saved in a human-readable format so that they can be viewed in a text editor by engineers and translators.

Example for `.po` file, translated strings:
```po

# Stationeers translation file generated by martian
#
#, fuzzy
msgid ""
msgstr ""
"PO-Revision-Date: 2019-02-08 22:25+0000\n"
"Last-Translator: Elfu <elfusan@gmail.com>\n"
"Language: pl\n"
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
"Plural-Forms: nplurals=3; plural=(n==1 ? 0 : n%10>=2 && n%10<=4 && (n%100<10 || n%100>=20) ? 1 : 2);\n"
"X-Generator: Pontoon\n"

#: /Language/Gases/Record[Key='Water']
msgctxt "Gases.Water"
msgid "Water"
msgstr "Woda"
```

Example for `.pot` file, translation template:

> A .POT is a Portable Object Template, which is also text-based.

```po
# Stationeers template translation file generated by martian.

#: /Language/Gases/Record[Key='Water']
msgctxt "Gases.Water"
msgid "Water"
msgstr ""
```

### Resources

The [resources](https://github.com/st-l10n/resources) repo contains in-game `.xml` files that 
are stored in `rocketstation_Data/StreamingAssets`.

Also contains some technical files, like:
* `assets.txt`, list of all files
* `hash.txt`, list of source (English) files with their hash
* `version.txt`, like `0.2.2713.13123`, game version

### Pontoon

The [pontoon](https://github.com/st-l10n/pontoon) repo contains fork of [mozilla/pontoon](https://github.com/mozilla/pontoon) that
implements oauth login via Discord.

## Components

### Pontoon server

Self-hosted instance of [Mozilla Pontoon](https://github.com/mozilla/pontoon).

Basically it is UI for collaborative translation implemented as Django application.

Requirements:

* PostgreSQL 
* RabbitMQ
* Celery worker that runs asynchronous jobs

### Periodical jobs

#### Pontoon sync

Runs "sync_projects" job every 5 minutes.

It commits any string changes in the database to the remote VCS servers
associated with each project, and pulls down the latest changes to keep
the database in sync.

```console
$ python manage.py sync_projects
```

#### Game sync

Runs "update-game.sh" script every 5 minutes.

Uses [SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD) (Steam console client) to periodically 
check for Stationeer updates (on "beta" branch) via special account.

If update is detected, script calls martian "update" command and commits changes.

Snippet from script:

```bash
echo "Martian start"
martian update --input ~/game/rocketstation_Data/StreamingAssets/
echo "Martian end"

find . -name "english*.xml" -type f -print0 | xargs -0 dos2unix
updateversion=$(grep -Po 'UPDATEVERSION=Update \S+' ~/game/rocketstation_Data/StreamingAssets/version.ini | sed -e "s/^UPDATEVERSION=Update //")
echo ${updateversion} > version.txt
find . -type f -name "english*.xml" -exec sha256sum "{}" \; > hash.txt

echo -e "Update ${updateversion}"
if [[ `git status --porcelain` ]]; then
  git config user.email "stationeers@gortc.io"
  git config user.name "Stationeers Bot"
  git add version.txt hash.txt
  git ls-files . | grep '\.xml$' | grep english --null | tr '\n' '\0' | xargs -0 -n1 git add
  git ls-files --others . | grep '\.xml$' | grep english --null | tr '\n' '\0' | xargs -0 -n1 git add
  git commit -m "automated update to ${updateversion}"
  git push origin master
else
  echo -e "No changes detected"
fi
```

Note that we can't use anonymous access here and login with password is required.
Moreover, every unique IP should be authenticated by Steam Guard manually.
Like that:
```console
$ ~/steam/steamcmd.sh
$ login stationeers_dl
Logging in user 'stationeers_dl' to Steam Public ...

password: 
$ ...
Steam Guard code:
$ 12345
```

### Triggered jobs

Currently, triggered jobs are managed by self-hosted [TeamCity](https://tc.st.gortc.io/) instance.

#### Resources build

Triggered on update to [locales](https://github.com/st-l10n/locales) repo, which is managed by Pontoon and contains
`.po` files.

Clones [resources](https://github.com/st-l10n/resources) repo (content of StreamingAssets)
and runs `martian bake` command. This effectively performs translation from English resources, generating
translated resources from `english_*.xml` files using `.po` files from [locales](https://github.com/st-l10n/locales) as
translation source.

When translation is done, it commits generated files to [resources](https://github.com/st-l10n/resources) repo,
generates `StreamingAssets.zip` file that is pushed to discord channel via `martian notify` command:
```console
martian notify --token ${discord_token} assets
```

#### Locales build

Triggered on update to [resources](https://github.com/st-l10n/resources) that touches `english_*.xml` files
(the exact trigger is `hash.txt` file).

Runs `martian generate` commands:
```bash
martian generate --output locales-new
martian generate --limit en --output locales-new --template=false
```

So it uses [resources](https://github.com/st-l10n/resources) repo to produce update to [locales](https://github.com/st-l10n/locales) repo.

This will generate `.pot` files that will be loaded to Pontoon, making them available for translation.
